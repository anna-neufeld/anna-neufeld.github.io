<h4> Inference for regression trees. </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:20px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    Working with Daniela Witten and Lucy Gao on valid inference for regression trees. In particular, given a regression tree, how can one test for a
    true difference in means between two terminal nodes, or obtain a valid confidence interval for the true mean in a given terminal node?
    As the terminal nodes are chosen by looking at the data, classical inference is invalid.

<h4>Longitudinal Regression Trees</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:20px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  For my senior thesis at Williams College, I worked with Professor Brianna Heggeseth on using regression trees to cluster longitudinal
  data. We were particularly motivated by clustering Body Mass Index (BMI) trajectories by their shape as opposed
  to by their level. I created created the R package <i> splinetree</i>, which implements regression trees and
  random forests for longitudinal data using a modified version of a spline projection method first proposed by Yu and Lambert (1999).
  The method allows users to build and evaluate trees using either the shape only or the shape and level of a trajectory.
  The R package is available on <a href = https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splinetree/index.html> CRAN
      </a>.

<h4>Modeling the Dynamics of Zika Virus. </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
Worked with Julie Blackwood and Lauren Childs alongside two other undergraduates to quantify the
contribution of sexual transmission in the spread of Zika virus and to study whether or not the asymmetric nature of
sexual transmission could place females at higher risk than males. This work was part of the SMALL REU at Williams College
in the summer of 2016 and was supported by a Clare Boothe Luce fellowship. The work resulted in a
<a href = https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28688996/> paper </a>  in <i> Epidemics </i>.
