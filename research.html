    Worked with Professor Brianna Heggeseth studying Longitudinal Regression Trees and their application to clustering Body Mass Index trajectories. Evaluated existing literature
    on longitudinal regression trees and conducted simulation studies to determine which methods would be appropriate for clustering BMI trajectories based on growth over time. Created
    the R package <i>splinetree</i>, which implements regression trees and random forests for longitudinal data using a modified version of a spline projection method first proposed by Yu and Lambert (1999).
