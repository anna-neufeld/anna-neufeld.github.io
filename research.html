<h1> Software </h1>
<ul>
  <li> R package <i> splinetree</i> implements regression trees and
  random forests for longitudinal data using a modified version of a spline projection method first proposed by Yu and Lambert (1999).
  The modified method allows users to build trees while paying attention to either a full trajectory or only the shape of
  a trajectory (ignoring its level). The R package is available on <a href = https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splinetree/index.html> CRAN
      </a>./<li>
