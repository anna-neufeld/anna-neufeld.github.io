<h1> Software </h1>
<ul>
  <li> R package <i> splinetree</i> implements regression trees and
  random forests for longitudinal data using a modified version of a spline projection method first proposed by Yu and Lambert (1999).
  The modified method allows users to group trajectories either by their full characteristics (shape and level) or by their shape
  only. The R package is available on <a href = https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splinetree/index.html> CRAN
      </a>.</li>
