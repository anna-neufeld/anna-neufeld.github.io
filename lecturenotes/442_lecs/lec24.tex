\section{Monday, May 12: One day on dimension reduction}

We cannot do justice to dimension reduction in one day. Whoops! My goal for today is to (a) make you all wish you had taken more courses in linear algebra, (b) give you a sense of what dimension reduction looks like in practice, (c) provide one fun example application (recommender systems). 


\subsection{The Singular Value Decomposition}

Recall our general setup of unsupervised learning. 


\subsection{Principal Components Analysis}


\subsection{Uses of Dimension Reduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item De-noising
\item Avoiding the curse of dimensionality
\item Learning latent concepts, etc.
\item Imputing missing values
\item Reccomender systems!	
\end{itemize}





\section{Thursday, May 15: Final presentations}

No lecture notes! Just 10 minute speed-talks by each project group.
