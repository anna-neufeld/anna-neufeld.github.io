\subsection{What is Spectral Clustering, and why might we use it?}

Presentation by Ali! 

\subsection{How can we do model validation for clustering}

Let's take a step backwards to Monday, and suppose for simplicity that we are working with k-means. How can we choose $k$?

This is actually a really wonderful question, and it relates to my research! We will discuss via a .Rmd walk-through, but I will also type some high-level points here.
