\begin{itemize}
\item Welcome and intros.
\item Going over the syllabus. 
\item What is statistical learning? 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Week 1}

\subsection*{2/10: Basics of supervised learning}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The basic setup of a supervised learning problem:
%$$
%Y = f(X)+\epsilon. 
%$$
%\item We estimate $f$ with $\hat{f}$. 
%\item Reducible vs. irreducible error. 
%\item Classification vs. regression: quantitative vs. categorical variables. note that its not only type. 
%\item Parametric vs. non-parametric.
%\item Goal of prediction vs. goal of inference / understanding? 
%\item Accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff.
%\item Need a notion of good performance. 
%\item I feel like chapter 2 of ISLR very very quickly HINTS at stuff that I don't really want to get to until later. 
%\item Bias variance tradeoff could be cool for week 1. But do I really want to do Bayes classifier? I don't think so! 
%\item I like the idea of framing Week 1 all around linear regression vs. 1NN, as Daniela did. Can I make that happen? With an IPAD? Oh god I will really need to practice. I don't think I want to be doing classification yet. I just want to be doing regression. 
%\item Pictures of 1NN vs. Linear Regression
%\item A good model has small squared error loss. The thing that minimizes the squared error loss is always going to be $E[Y \mid X=x]$. Can we prove this? BUt we cannot actually compute this!!! KNN approximates this if enough data and smooth! Is this decision theory? What are we doing!
%\item Question that sets up this course. Should I prefer linear regression or KNN?? 
%\item Let's just work in one dimension for the moment. 
%\item I want to discuss bias variance tradeoff. 
%\item Expected TEST error is bias and variance.
%\item Have I already discussed train and test?? UGH. 
%\item Error is irreducible plus bias squared plus variance. 
%\item 1NN has no bias but high variance. U hsped curve. constant mean has no variance.
