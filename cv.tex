\section{Research Experience}

{\textbf{Research Assistant (University of Washington)} \hfill 2020-Present
\begin{itemize}
\item Advisor: Daniela Witten
\item Working on methods for valid inference after model selection in the context of regression trees and single cell RNA-sequencing pipelines. 
\end{itemize} 

{\textbf{Williams College Undergraduate Honors Thesis}} \hfill 2017-2018 
\begin{itemize}
\item Advisor: Brianna Heggeseth
\item Proposed using longitudinal regression trees to study the impact of early exposure to environmental pollutants on the shape of body mass index trajectories later in life. After developing novel evaluation metrics to measure the ``shape-based" accuracy of a tree, developed a spline projection method that groups individuals by the shape of their individual trajectory while ignoring the level of their trajectory. 
\end{itemize} 

{\textbf{SMALL Research Experience for Undergraduates}} \hfill Summer 2016
