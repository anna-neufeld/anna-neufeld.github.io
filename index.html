  <p>
  Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>
    at the University of Washington. My current research is in selective inference, and I am advised by
      <a href="https://www.danielawitten.com/"> Daniela Witten </a>.
    Before coming to UW, I recieved undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science at <a href = " https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>
    (go Ephs!). At Williams, I researched dynamics of infectious disease with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/jcb5/"> Julie Blackwood </a> as part of the
      <a href = https://math.williams.edu/small/> SMALL REU </a> and I wrote a senior thesis about regression trees for longitudinal data with
      <a href=https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth> Brianna Heggeseth </a>. I am passionate about statistics education and
      love teaching and working with undergraduates. Here is a link to my <a href = "https://anna-neufeld.github.io/cv.pdf"> CV </a>.
