  <p class="about-content">
    Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, advised by 
    <a href="https://jtleek.com"> Jeff Leek </a>. I recently recieved my PhD from the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.danielawitten.com/"> Daniela Witten</a>. I am interested in problems related to "double dipping" and selective inference, and I am particularly motivated by applications to genomic data. 
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">
    Before coming to UW, I recieved an undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at
    <a href = " https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>. At Williams, I researched dynamics of infectious disease with
    <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/jcb5/">Julie Blackwood </a> as part of the
    <a href = https://math.williams.edu/small/> SMALL REU </a> and I wrote a senior thesis about regression trees
    for longitudinal data with  <a href=https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth> Brianna Heggeseth</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">
