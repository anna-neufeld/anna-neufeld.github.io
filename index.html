  <p class="about-content">
    Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, advised by 
    <a href="https://jtleek.com"> Jeff Leek </a>. In 2023, I received my PhD from the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of Washington, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.danielawitten.com/"> Daniela Witten</a>. I am interested in problems related to "double dipping" and selective inference, and I am particularly motivated by applications to genomic data. Before UW, I received undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science at
 <a href = " https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>. In the fall of 2024, I will be returning to the Purple Valley to be an assistant professor of statistics at Williams. I am passionate about statistics education and love teaching and working with undergraduates. Outside of work, I like riding my bike slowly and playing ball sports badly. Here is a link to my <a href = "https://anna-neufeld.github.io/cv.pdf"> CV</a>.
