  <p class="about-content">
    Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>
    at the University of Washington. My current research is in selective inference, and I am advised by
    <a href="https://www.danielawitten.com/"> Daniela Witten </a>.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">
    Before coming to UW, I recieved undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science at
    <a href = " https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>
    . At Williams, I researched dynamics of infectious disease with
    <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/jcb5/">Julie Blackwood </a> as part of the
    <a href = https://math.williams.edu/small/> SMALL REU </a> and I wrote a senior thesis about regression trees
    for longitudinal data with  <a href=https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth> Brianna Heggeseth</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">
    I am passionate about statistics education and love teaching and working with undergraduates.
    I co-founded and currently serve on the organizing committee for the
    <a href= https://spa-drp.github.io/> statistics Directed Reading Program </a>at UW.
